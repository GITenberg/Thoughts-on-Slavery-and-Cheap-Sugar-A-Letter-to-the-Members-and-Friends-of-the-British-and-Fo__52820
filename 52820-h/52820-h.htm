<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span><i>To
the Members and Friends of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery
Society</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the Annual Meeting of your
Society, that has just been held, one of the most crowded you
have ever convened, the able and eloquent advocate of free trade,
George Thompson, succeeded in carrying an amendment,
notwithstanding the avowed opposition of your officers and
Committee; an amendment of the most essential importance,
pledging you to the consideration of a subject that threatens to
impair the usefulness, and to imperil the very existence of the
Society you support.&nbsp; As a sincere well-wisher to that
Society, as one eager with yourselves for the abolition of
slavery throughout the world, the writer of the following pages
beseeches you to peruse them in the spirit of anxious solicitude
with which they were penned.</p>
<p>You must be aware, by the course you are pursuing, you are
losing the sympathies of the popular mind.&nbsp; If you heed not
what you are about, the results of last <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Friday&rsquo;s vote will materially
impair your strength.&nbsp; You are already quoted by men who
have no interests in common with the people; you are an authority
in the mouths of Conservative statesmen: the advocates of
monopoly, and bloodshed, and death, for the former implies the
latter, tell us you sanction their proceedings, and smile
complacently on their resort to measures that can only derive
efficacy from the fact, that they are backed by the
soldier&rsquo;s sword.&nbsp; Religious and peaceable men, as you
are, with full faith, believing what reason and revelation alike
teach, that truth&mdash;mere truth&mdash;simple and alone, is
stronger than the iron arm of might, succumbs to no power, in
heaven above, or on the earth beneath, how can you, how dare you,
give the lie to the principles you profess, and ask the aid of
government, which is based alone upon physical force?&nbsp; Think
you, by the bayonet and ball, to ennoble your noble cause?&nbsp;
Know you so little of earth&rsquo;s history, as for one moment to
suppose that wrong ever became right, or that by the employment
of means which error has used with success, you can obtain even
the shadow of a gain for the sacred cause of truth?</p>
<p>Sir Robert Peel, the forlorn hope of rulers who have come into
the world a century too late, and who obstinately continue to
oppose the advancing stream, by which they will assuredly be
swept away, has done you the questionable honour of alluding to
you, as on his side, in opposition to the people&rsquo;s
friends.&nbsp; How he abhors slavery, he has shown in the
reduction he has announced in the duties on coffee, which employs
three-fourths of <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>the slaves in Brazil.&nbsp; Will this be no stimulus to
slavery there?&nbsp; Or is the slave only the subject of your
deep concern, when he is employed in the cultivation of
sugar?&nbsp; The editors of the &ldquo;Anti-Slavery
Reporter&rdquo; complain of being misrepresented, and blame Mr.
Cobden for blaming them, as if they approved of the government
scheme.&nbsp; But unfortunately you and the government have
entered into partnership&mdash;Sir Robert Peel helps you, and you
help him.&nbsp; It is the firm we find fault with.&nbsp; One
member may not exactly approve of every thing his partner does,
but he must bear it as best he can.&nbsp; We learn &ldquo;from
the ordinary channels of information,&rdquo; as &ldquo;they say
in another place,&rdquo; that Mr. Barber is very indignant at the
idea of being made a sharer in the guilt of Mr. Fletcher, and his
amiable accomplice, in the forgery of wills.&nbsp; We doubt not
but that your Committee can quite sympathise in Mr.
Barber&rsquo;s righteous indignation.&nbsp; If they wished to
avoid the charge of hypocrisy, which may be fairly brought
against the West Indian monopoly party in the House of Commons,
they should have acted as Mr. Barber must wish he had
acted&mdash;they should have refused to be made the tools of any
man, or set of men.</p>
<p>This has not been done.&nbsp; The odium that attaches to the
government is yours.&nbsp; The slave-holder would, ere now, have
been driven from the market&mdash;he would have stood before the
world blasted in character and worth, had you never descended
from the high ground on which it is given the advocate of truth
to stand&mdash;had you never pandered to political
factions&mdash;had you never given to party &ldquo;what was meant
for mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Tory press <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>have come to
your aid; and if you have the least regard for the great cause of
which you are the pledged supporters, you will scorn the
envenomed slanderers who supply what they need in reasoning, by
the most vulgar and disgusting abuse. <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; It would be
well, too, if some of your own Committee who are connected with
the public press, would pause ere they impute incompetency to
consider the question to those who gave the verdict last Friday,
at Exeter Hall.&nbsp; That they were beaten is no argument
whatever why they should insult those who differed in opinion
from themselves.&nbsp; The Editor of the <i>Patriot</i> thought
otherwise, else why were we told the question was too abstruse
for us to settle?&nbsp; Are we to wait till his powerful
intellect has made it clear?&nbsp; Does he not know that while
the Committee were continuing in the old routine, the public mind
had arrived at an opposite decision?&nbsp; Men have learned at
last that slavery can only be destroyed by freedom; that given,
the right to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the
dearest&mdash;and the employer of free men will soon be left
alone in the field.</p>
<p>With these few remarks, gentlemen, the writer would commend
the Thoughts on Slavery and Cheap Sugar to your most attentive
perusal.&nbsp; The subject is of no common importance.&nbsp; If
you are wrong, you are altogether wrong, and are a curse instead
of a blessing&mdash;a curse to the slaves abroad&mdash;a curse to
the negro on the coast of Africa, who is now murdered when he was
before sold as <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>a slave, and whom we would civilise and christianise by
transporting to the untilled fields of Jamaica <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&mdash;a curse to the labourer at home,
whose wretched existence you help to render more wretched
still.&nbsp; Well may you shudder as you think of the
responsibility you incur.&nbsp; Consider well your present
course&mdash;momentous interests are at stake.&nbsp; Let your
decision be calm and unprejudiced&mdash;not given in deference to
well-meaning and respectable men&mdash;not from any uneasy
sensation of annoyance or ill-will, but such as will be in
accordance with the light you have.&nbsp; Your cause is a popular
one, and you must be in a false position when you find yourselves
opposed to the popular will.&nbsp; This one fact of itself ought
to excite suspicion.&nbsp; Advocating as you do the rights and
dignity of man, you and the creatures and champions of a
fictitious aristocracy can have no common ground, and can never
be found on a common side.&nbsp; To be amongst such men at all,
you must have drifted from your moorings.&nbsp; Look well to it
that you rectify this error in time.</p>
<p>One word about the pamphlet.&nbsp; It is written with no
reference whatever to the government scheme.&nbsp; It is hardly
worth while to attack a measure which surely your Committee will
not defend&mdash;a measure which will merely drive slave-grown
sugar from one market to another&mdash;a measure which opens the
door abundantly to fraud, and to those immoralities with which
fraud is always accompanied.&nbsp; The writer&rsquo;s object has
been to show that our <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>past mode of procedure has not
destroyed slavery;&mdash;that the adopting the principles of
free-trade alone can do this; and that such a course would be a
great national boon.&nbsp; All he aims at is the truth; and he
should be happy to stand corrected when in the wrong.</p>
<p>That you, gentlemen, may calmly and seriously consider the
momentous question discussed in these pages, and that the
valuable Society, which has so many claims on your regard, may
continue to exist and act with increasing power, till slavery be
abolished, is the sincere wish and prayer of</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">The
Author</span>.</p>
<p><i>Camden Town</i>, <i>May</i> 20, 1844.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>THOUGHTS, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Eleven</span> years have passed away
since, at an enormous cost, slavery was abolished in the British
dominions.&nbsp; The day that witnessed the act is one memorable
in the annals of our country.&nbsp; It stands out conspicuously,
and throws into the shade much over which the Christian and the
patriot cannot choose but mourn.&nbsp; All honour be given to the
men by whom it was carried.&nbsp; Let the fame and name of such
benefactors of their race as Granville Sharp, Zachary Macaulay,
William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, ever live fresh and fair in
the remembrances of an admiring posterity.&nbsp; Theirs be the
praise due to all who, through good and bad report, in faith and
sincerity, give battle for the right, when weaker men are cowed
down by might; and glorious is it to know that the words they
spoke had in them life and power&mdash;that they reached the
heart of England&rsquo;s millions, so that the cry for justice to
the sons of Africa was borne as by the winds of heaven over the
length and breadth of this thickly-peopled isle, and was heard in
morning light and <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>evening&rsquo;s shade, when man went forth to his work,
or when he rested from the labours of the day, till at length
Great Britain washed her hands of the stain she had contracted by
her sanction of the accursed traffic in flesh and blood, and
proclaimed freedom and manhood to the slave.</p>
<p>So far so good.&nbsp; Whatever imperfections may have attended
it, it was a noble act&mdash;one of which we may well be proud;
on the part of the many, it was done in sincerity and
truth.&nbsp; The enlightened people of England considered it
almost as a boon to themselves.&nbsp; There was joy and rejoicing
at home as well as in the green islands of the west.&nbsp; When
the morning dawned on which the slave, the black, stepped forth
unchained and free, praise and thanksgivings burst from the lips
of others than the long-oppressed descendants of Ham.&nbsp; It
was the triumph of humanity; and man, wherever he lived, and
whatever his lot, could well be glad.</p>
<p>Years have passed, and the people of England have not as yet
reaped the benefit to which they were fairly entitled by the
sacrifices they made.&nbsp; There is a monopoly in favour of West
India produce, which deprives the working man of this country of
an essential article of food.&nbsp; Slavery still remains, and,
till that monopoly is abolished, will remain.&nbsp; Our abolition
of it was regarded as an experiment by slave-holding
states&mdash;an experiment which they now consider to have
entirely failed.&nbsp; It is quite natural they should arrive at
such a conclusion.&nbsp; What we have done has been but
little.&nbsp; We have merely withdrawn from the slave-market our
demand for slaves.&nbsp; It remains for us to show, that
economically as well as morally we have made a change for the
better; that the labour of free men is more productive than that
of slaves.&nbsp; By keeping up our monopoly we practically
declare the reverse.&nbsp; We supply the slave-holder with his <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>strongest
arguments against abolition; and, by giving him an advantage over
us in the markets of the world, we afford a stimulus to slavery
itself; and thus commit what we profess to abhor.&nbsp;
Slave-owners are not remarkable for a high moral sense; could we
show them that it was for their interest to emancipate their
slaves, they would not be long ere they became our
converts.&nbsp; As it is, we appeal to them in vain.&nbsp; To the
voice of the charmer they are deaf.&nbsp; Even Lord
Brougham&rsquo;s silvery tones and gentle pleadings fail to move
and win; nor does Joseph Sturge meet with a better fate.</p>
<p>Slavery is a tremendous ill&mdash;an unmitigated curse; earth
cannot produce its equal.&nbsp; Where it rears its hideous head,
all that raises man above the beast, and makes life a thing to be
desired, languishes and dies.&nbsp; Its state is dark as
night&mdash;dreary as death&mdash;terrible as hell.&nbsp; For
putting it down two plans have been proposed.&nbsp; It can be
destroyed, it is said, by government interference, by treaties,
by armed power.&nbsp; This has been tried; we shall now see with
what effect.&nbsp; As soon as, in 1807, Parliament had passed a
bill abolishing the British slave trade, by doing which we but
did what was done in Denmark in 1792, the British ministers at
all foreign courts were ordered to negotiate treaties for the
abolition of the slave-trade.&nbsp; Mr. Laird tells us&mdash;<a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They commenced with Portugal, after nine
years&rsquo; labour, concluding a treaty in 1810.&nbsp; In 1815
Great Britain paid &pound;300,000 for seizing Portugal vessels
engaged in the trade up to the 1st June, 1814; and the same year
gave up to her &pound;600,000, for another treaty putting an end
to the Portuguese slave-trade,&rdquo; except for the purpose of
supplying the transatlantic possessions belonging to the crown of
Portugal.&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1817, a third <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>treaty was
made, under which the Mixed Commission Courts and Preventive
Squadron were established.&nbsp; In 1823, another treaty was
brought forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the mean while the trade carried
on by miscreants of all nations, under the fraudulent cover of
the Portuguese flag, became a disgrace to Christendom. <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1889, the British
Parliament took the law into their own hands, and passed an act
authorising British cruisers to seize Portuguese vessels engaged
in the slave-trade, and constituting British Vice-Admiralty
Courts to condemn them.&nbsp; In 1842, this law was repealed, and
a fifth treaty has been made with Portugal.&nbsp; We are
therefore about to recommence the same round again with this
power; though the increase of the trade under our former treaties
was from 25,000 slaves in 1807 to 56,000 in 1822; and in 1839,
forty-eight vessels, under the Portuguese flag (out of a total of
sixty-one slave-vessels) were condemned at Sierra
Leone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We next come to Spain.&nbsp; In 1814, we offered her a bribe
of &pound;800,000 if she would abolish the slave-trade at the end
of five years.&nbsp; This she refused, but promised to prohibit
the trade, except for Spanish possessions.&nbsp; In 1815 we got
her to sign, with other powers, at the Congress of Vienna, a
declaration &ldquo;that the slave trade is repugnant to the
principles of humanity and of universal morality.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
1817, another treaty was got, on our paying &pound;400,000 for
it; and in 1822, a third; and &ldquo;the sea swarmed with
slave-ships, carrying on the slave-trade under the flag of
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="citation12b"></a><a
href="#footnote12b" class="citation">[12b]</a>&nbsp; And so it
continued until 1836, when the fourth, or Clarendon treaty was
made; which Sir Fowell Buxton designates &ldquo;an impudent
fraud,&rdquo; but which Mr. Bandinell thinks perfection, or as
near perfection as a treaty can get.&nbsp; In it was embodied an
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>equipment
clause, by which a vessel with certain articles and fittings on
board is liable to condemnation.&nbsp; This has had the effect of
diminishing the trade carried on under the Spanish flag, but the
number of slaves landed in Cuba does not appear to have been at
all affected by it; forty-three vessels entering the port of
Havanna, after landing their slaves on the coast of Cuba, in
1836; the annual average number in the next four years being
forty-five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears, therefore, that for our &pound;400,000 paid
in 1817 we have got four treaties, under which the supply of the
Spanish colonies with slaves has gone on as regularly as that of
any other article of commerce, increasing and diminishing with
the demand for them; that in the mean time we have, as
slave-catchers for them, handed over to their tender mercies
several thousand emancipados at the Havanna, who are a degree
worse off than the slaves themselves; and our consul having
contrived an ingenious plan to get back some of these poor
people, has had his &lsquo;exequatur&rsquo; withdrawn, and turned
out of the colony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the separation of Brazil from Portugal, negotiations
were entered into to induce the Brazilian government to abandon
the slave trade; and, in 1826, a treaty was entered into
declaring it piracy, after 1830, when a mixed British and
Brazilian court were to adjudicate on seizures.&nbsp; The
greatest exertions were used to import slaves from the date of
this treaty, and the vessels were consequently much more crowded
than usual; yet, out of 150,587 slaves legally imported into Rio
Janeiro between the 1st July, 1827, and 31st December, 1830, when
it became a smuggling trade, the mortality on the middle passage
was <i>only eight per cent.</i>&nbsp; In 1831, the trade still
going on, Don Pedro issued a decree, declaring all slaves brought
into Brazil <span class="GutSmall">FREE</span>.&nbsp; In 1835, a
new treaty was entered into with Great Britain, similar to the
Spanish <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>one of the same date, which the Brazilian legislature
refused to ratify then, and repeated the refusal in
1840.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The result of our treaty-making with
Brazil, according to the source of information, the Parliamentary
Papers A and B, has been an increase in the extent of her trade,
accompanied with an increase in the cruelty with which it is
carried on; the mortality being raised on the middle passage from
8 per cent. in 1830, to 25 per cent. in
1840.&rdquo;&mdash;(Buxton, p. 174.)&nbsp; In the mean time our
cruisers have captured some thousand negroes; and &ldquo;every
account received from Brazil of the state of the negroes, who had
been <i>nominally</i> emancipated by sentence of the mixed
commission courts, shows that in reality they have continued to
be slaves.&rdquo;&mdash;(Bandinell, p. 235.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the vessels bearing Portuguese, Spanish, and Barbarian
flags, are the only ones employed in the conveyance of slaves
from America within the tropics, it is hardly necessary to allude
to the treaties which Government has, with a praiseworthy
pertinacity, concluded with other countries that never had any
slave trade at all.&nbsp; For the same reason we pass by those
entered into with the enlightened chiefs who rule on the coasts
and rivers of Africa, and whose sanction has been purchased by
<i>scarlet</i> coats, <i>cocked</i> hats, and <i>plush
unmentionables</i>.&nbsp; The conclusion of the whole matter is,
that our treaties have been in vain.&nbsp; We are as far from the
desired end as ever.</p>
<p>On the 26th of December, 1839, Lord John Russell, after
referring to the failure of treaties that had been concluded,
stated, &ldquo;That her Majesty&rsquo;s confidential advisers are
therefore compelled to admit the conviction that it is
indispensable to enter upon some new preventive
system.&rdquo;&mdash;(Parl. Papers, No. 57, 8th Feb. 1840.)&nbsp;
In the same year Sir Fowell Buxton made a confession of a similar
character.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is then,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;but
too manifest, that the efforts already made for the suppression
of the slave trade have not accomplished their benevolent
object.&nbsp; Millions of money and multitudes of lives have been
sacrificed; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>and, in return for all, we have only the afflicting
conviction that the slave trade is as far as ever from being
suppressed.&rdquo;&mdash;(Buxton, p. 203.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Once
more, then, I must declare my conviction, that the slave trade
will never be suppressed by the system hitherto
pursued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1821, her Majesty&rsquo;s commissioners at Sierra Leone
report only one case brought before them, and that the trade was
decreasing.&nbsp; Ten years afterwards they report its
increase.&nbsp; &ldquo;There would then appear at present, we
regret to say, but little likelihood of the slave trade ever
being suppressed by the present restrictive measures employed to
prevent that traffic.&rdquo;&mdash;(Parl. Paper, A., 1831.)</p>
<p>On the 31st of December, twenty years after the establishment
of the mixed commission courts, Messrs. Macaulay and Doherty made
the following statement to Lord Palmerston, in which they
confessed the utter failure of the means that had been
pursued.&nbsp; After referring to the powers possessed by England
for the purpose of putting down the inhuman trade in slaves, they
observe:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But whatever other means may be necessary
in a time of profound peace to give effect to England&rsquo;s
interpretation of the law of nations, those means she will not
surely hesitate to adopt, when her <i>only other alternative
is</i>, <i>retiring at once from a contest which she has long
waged</i>, <i>baffled</i>, <i>beaten</i>, <i>and insulted by a

treaties have thus been powerless for good; and, what is worse,
they have been powerful for bad.&nbsp; The horrors of the middle
passage have been immeasurably increased.&nbsp; The more
stringent the treaties the more inhuman becomes the trade; and
the only result will be aggravated sufferings to the unfortunate
victims of our well-meaning philanthropy.&nbsp; The greater the
risks the higher the profits; and there will always be desperate
men&mdash;men who have nothing to lose&mdash;who will expose
themselves to any dangers to win the gold they love.&nbsp; One
successful voyage amply compensates for the sufferings and
dangers they endure.&nbsp; Instead of having large roomy vessels,
we have compelled the slave dealers to use vessels the most unfit
in character, and destitute of the most necessary
accommodation.&nbsp; In 1841, the Jesus Maria, of 85 tons size,
with 278 slaves, and 19 passengers and crew, made the voyage
across the Atlantic.&nbsp; If the reader thinks of a Cowes
pilot-boat, with 297 human beings beneath the sun of the tropics,
he may form some idea of the sufferings to which the slaves must
have been exposed.&nbsp; By our present system we cannot destroy,
though we can add, and that in no common degree, to the cruelty
of the voyage.&nbsp; The high profits will always attract the man
of ruined hopes and character, and such there always are to seize
every project&mdash;to encounter every risk.&nbsp; On the east
coast of Africa negroes are usually paid for in money, or coarse
cottons.&nbsp; The men fetch 15 dollars, the boys 12.&nbsp; At
Rio Janeiro their value may be estimated at 52<i>l.</i> for the
men; 41<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> for women, and 31<i>l.</i> for
boys.&nbsp; Thus on a cargo of 500, at the mean price, the

<p>Have our readers met with &ldquo;Fifty Days on Board a
Slaver,&rdquo; by the Rev. Pascoe Grenfell Hill?&nbsp;
<i>That</i> shows the value of armed suppression.&nbsp; Mr. Hill
has done good <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>service by exposing the horrors of British mercy.&nbsp;
Mr. Hill was chaplain on board her Majesty&rsquo;s ship the
Cleopatra, when she captured the Progresso last April
twelvemonth, in the Mozambique channel.&nbsp; When she fell in
with the Progresso, the slave vessel had been laden but a few
hours, and there had been no time to generate disease.&nbsp;
However a change soon took place, and we must borrow Mr.
Hill&rsquo;s words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A squall approached, of which I and others
who had laid down on the deck received warning by a few heavy
drops of rain.&nbsp; Then ensued a scene the horrors of which it
is impossible to depict.&nbsp; The hands having to shorten sail
suddenly, uncertain as to the force of the squall, found the poor
helpless creatures lying about the deck an obstruction to getting
at the ropes, and doing what was required.&nbsp; This caused the
order to send them all below, which was immediately obeyed.&nbsp;
The night, however, being intensely hot and close, 400 wretched
beings thus crammed into a hold, twelve yards in length, seven in
breadth, and only three feet and a half in height, speedily began
to make an effort to reissue to the open air.&nbsp; Being thrust
back, and striving the more to get out, the after hatch was
forced down on them.&nbsp; Over the other hatchway in the
fore-part of the vessel, a wooden grating was fastened.&nbsp; To
this the sole inlet for the air, the suffocating heat of the
hold, and, perhaps, panic from the strangeness of their
situation, made them press, and thus great part of the space
below was rendered useless.&nbsp; They crowded to the grating,
and, clinging to it for air, completely barred its
entrance.&nbsp; They strove to force their way through apertures
in length fourteen inches, and barely six inches in breadth, and
in some instances succeeded.&nbsp; The cries&mdash;the heat, I
may say without exaggeration, the smoke of their
torment&mdash;which ascended, can be compared to nothing
earthly.&nbsp; One of the Spaniards gave warning that the
consequences would be &lsquo;many deaths.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thursday,
April 13th, (Holy Thursday,) the Spaniard&rsquo;s prediction of
last night was this morning fearfully verified.&nbsp; Fifty-four
crushed and mangled corpses lifted up from the slave deck; some
were brought to the gangway and thrown overboard; some were
emaciated from disease; many were bruised and bloody.&nbsp;
Antonio tells me that some were found strangled&mdash;their hands
still grasping each other&rsquo;s throats&mdash;and tongues
protruding from their mouths.&nbsp; The bowels of one were
crushed out; <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>they had been trampled to death, for the most part, the
weaker under the feet of the stronger, in the madness and torment
of suffocation from crowd and heat.&nbsp; It was a horrid sight
as they passed one by one&mdash;the stiff distorted limbs smeared
with blood and filth&mdash;to be cast into the sea; some still
quivering were laid on the deck to die; salt water thrown on them
to revive them, and a little fresh water poured into their
mouths.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we hasten to the close of this scene of death.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As soon as the Progresso anchored, we were
visited by the health officer, who immediately admitted us to
pratique.&nbsp; My friend Mr. Shea, then superintendent of the
naval hospital, also paid us a visit, and I descended with him,
for the last time, to the slave hold.&nbsp; Long accustomed as he
has been to scenes of suffering, he was unable to endure a sight
surpassing, he said, &lsquo;all he could have conceived of human
misery,&rsquo; and made a hasty retreat.&nbsp; One little girl,
crying bitterly, was entangled between the planks, wanting
strength to extricate her wasted limbs, till assistance was given
her.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a voyage of fifty days, there occurred one hundred and
sixty-three deaths!&nbsp; Can slavery be worse than this? if this
melancholy tale teaches anything, it is evidently the uselessness
of armed suppression.</p>
<p>And yet this wretched, this utterly inefficient system, is to
be continued and extended.&nbsp; A new remedy has been proposed
by the Honourable Captain Denman, which it appears Sir Robert
Peel is about to sanction.&nbsp; Colonel Nicolls says, it will
put the slave trade down in ten or twelve months,&mdash;this we
more than doubt.&nbsp; A blockade which, to be effectual, must
extend over six thousand miles of coast, is not so easy a thing
as it may seem on paper.&nbsp; With Lord John Russell we believe,
&ldquo;that to suppress the slave trade by a marine guard is
impossible, were the whole British navy employed in the
attempt.&rdquo;&nbsp; A British force may burn the baracoons, but
as long as the demand exists, a supply from some quarter or other
will be procured.&nbsp; To show that the Colonel&rsquo;s logic is
not absolutely perfect, we quote the following fact.&nbsp; It was
thought the <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>destruction of the baracoons at Gallinas, in 1840, would
have prevented their re-formation, but this does not appear to
have been the case.&nbsp; The commissioners observe, &ldquo;We
have received information that, during the last rains, no less
than three slave factories were settled in the Gallinas, whither
the factors and goods had been conveyed by an American
vessel.&rdquo;&mdash;(Slave Trade Papers, 1843.)&nbsp; Destroy
the nests, and the birds will not breed, says Colonel
Nicolls.&nbsp; The gallant colonel forgets that the demand for
slaves, and not the existence of baracoons, creates the slave
trade; to borrow an illustration from Adam Smith, a man is not
rich because he keeps a coach and four horses; but he keeps a
coach and four horses because he is rich.&nbsp; Men make but an
indifferent hand at reasoning when they are unable to tell which
is the cause, and which the effect.</p>
<p>Had this system been attended by any the smallest amount of
good, we should have kept out of account altogether the last item
in this part of our subject, to which we shall refer the
reader&mdash;that of expense; but when we find the money thus
squandered has produced no earthly good whatever, when all
parties confess that past measures have ended in utter failure,
and that the slave trade, so far from being put down in all its
forms of abomination and cruelty, is more vigorous than before;
it is but right that we should exclaim against the waste of money
that has been so lavishly incurred.&nbsp; Sir Fowell Buxton
estimates the expense, on the part of Great Britain, in carrying
out the slave trade preventive system up to 1839, at
&pound;15,000,000.&nbsp; We here quote from Mr. Laird:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s late commissioner of inquiry on the
coast of Africa, estimates the expense incurred there,
<i>independently of the salaries and contingencies at home</i>,
<i>of officers connected with the Anti-Slavery Treaty
Department</i>, at &pound;229,090 per annum; and by the finance
accounts, I find, that for <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the year ending 5th January, 1842,
&pound;57,024 was paid out of the consolidated fund, to the
officers and crews of her Majesty&rsquo;s ships, for bounty on
slaves, and tonnage on slave vessels.&nbsp; These gallant men,
however, do not think they get what they ought to do; for there
is a long correspondence about what they lose by the way the
prizes are measured for tonnage-money; but it must be consolatory
to them to know that they have, in one year, received
&pound;1,000 more prize money than their predecessors did in
nine; the amount of prize money paid for capturing slaves, from
1814 to 1822, being only &pound;56,017.&nbsp; In fact the African
station has been improving in value, as a naval command, since
the slave trade treaties; it is now the <i>bonne bouche</i> of
the Admiralty, and as such was given to the last first
lord&rsquo;s brothers.&nbsp; The mixed commission courts cost the
country about &pound;15,000 per annum; and as any dispute between
the Portuguese, Spanish, or Brazilian judges is settled by an
appeal to the dice box, the monotony of their lives is agreeably
diversified; having retiring salaries, the patronage is
valuable.&nbsp; The whole annual cost may be taken at
&pound;300,000.&rdquo; <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a></p>
<p>So much for this part of our subject.&nbsp; We may fairly
conclude, that such a system is evidently vicious in principle:
it has certainly failed to answer the end proposed, and the
sooner it is given up the better.&nbsp; But let it not be for one
moment understood that we consider slavery always will remain the
curse and shame of humanity.&nbsp; We believe that it can be
extinguished,&mdash;that it must be extinguished,&mdash;that,
sooner or later, God&rsquo;s sun shall shine every where upon the
<i>free</i>, and that slavery shall remain alone in the dark
records of earth&rsquo;s misery and crime.</p>
<p>Freedom is the antagonist of slavery.&nbsp; Free labour must
drive out of the market the labour of the slave.&nbsp; We were <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>told before
emancipation, that the former was cheaper than the latter: we
have yet to learn that it is not.&nbsp; A glance at the present
condition of the sugar-producing countries will convince any one
that the West India planter has immense advantages over his rival
of Cuba or Brazil.</p>
<p>There is a great amount of misunderstanding on this
subject.&nbsp; The soil of the West India Islands is always
represented as exhausted, which is far from being actually the
case.&nbsp; In Cuba, according to an estimate made by the
patriotic society of Havanna, it appears that two hundred and
fifteen acres of <i>new</i> land are expected to produce, in cane
cultivation, thirteen hundred boxes of sugar, or 2172 lbs. per
acre.&nbsp; We may reasonably infer, that the production in
Brazil does not equal this.&nbsp; We find that the exports of
sugar from the latter country have rather declined, while those
of Cuba have been nearly doubled within the last few years; while
from the evidence taken by a committee of the House of Commons,
it appears that with the present imperfect system of cultivation,
the following results have been obtained, including ratroons, or
canes cut for several years successively. <a

<p>A pretty fair result, it must be confessed, considering the
exhausted condition of the soil.&nbsp; Another advantage the West
India Islands possess over Brazil, arises from their facilities
for water carriage.&nbsp; Their limited extent is anything but a
drawback,&mdash;it makes them all sea coast.&nbsp; With labour
and capital, they would be put in a position <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>that would
enable them to under-sell slave-grown sugar.&nbsp; The great
disadvantage under which they suffer, is scarcity of
labour.&nbsp; Antigua alone has, in this respect, a sufficient
supply, and let us hear the result.&nbsp; The first witness we
shall call is Captain Larlyle, governor of French Guiana.&nbsp;
The captain was sent by the French government to visit most of
the British West India Islands, and to see the working of the
present system; the report he made has been published by
government, in a work, entitled, &ldquo;Abolition de
l&rsquo;Esclavage dans les Colonies Anglaises.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Evidently his prejudices are for the continuance of slavery, but
with respect to Antigua, he was forced to bear witness of a
contrary character.&nbsp; He observes, (our quotations are from
the Anti-Slavery Reporter, of May 1st, 1844,) that &ldquo;it has
maintained, during the last seven years, a state of prosperity,
which every impartial person cannot fail to acknowledge.&rdquo;
p. 189.&nbsp; &ldquo;The exports have rather increased than
diminished since emancipation.&rdquo; pp. 194, 5.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If, under the system of slavery, labour had been as
complete and productive as it ought to have been, if the negroes
had employed the time to their best advantage, there is no doubt
but they would have produced more than at present, when, in
consequence of freedom, the fields have lost a third of their
labourers.&nbsp; But I have had occasion to say, in my former
reports, that forced labour has never answered the expectations
that have been formed respecting it; and I find a new proof of
this in the table of production in Antigua during fifteen
years.&rdquo; p. 196.&nbsp; Again, Captain Larlyle says,
&ldquo;If the colonists are to be believed, the plantations are
worth, without the negroes, as much as they were worth formerly
with their gangs of slaves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Equally favourable is
the evidence of a lady who resided in Antigua, both before and
after the emancipation of the slaves, and who possessed the most
ample opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of the <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>working of
either system.&nbsp; After referring to the depressed state of
the island before the abolition of slavery, she observes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But this oppression did not long continue;
for no sooner was the deed done, and the chain which bound the
negro to his fellow-man irrecoverably snapped asunder, than it
was found, even by the most sceptical, that free labour was
decidedly more advantageous to the planter than the old system of
slavery; that, in fact, an estate could be worked for less by
free labour than it could when so many slaves, including old and
young, weak and strong, were obliged to be maintained by the
proprietors.&nbsp; Indeed, the truth of this assertion was
discovered even before the negroes were free; for no sooner did
the planters feel that no effort of theirs could prevent
emancipation from taking place, than they commenced to calculate
seriously the probable result of the change, and to their
surprise found, upon mature deliberation, that their expenses
would be diminished, and their comforts increased, by the
abolition of slavery.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, we are told, although there are some few persons who
deny that free labour is less expensive than slavery, yet the
general voice pronounces it a system beneficial to the
country.</p>
<p>It has been proved to demonstration that estates which, under
the old system, were clogged with debts they never could have
paid off, have, since emancipation, not only cleared themselves,
but put a handsome income into the pockets of their
proprietors.&nbsp; Land was also increased greatly in
value.&nbsp; Sugar plantations that would scarcely find a
purchaser before emancipation, will now command from
&pound;10,000 sterling; <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a> while many estates
that were abandoned in days of slavery, are now once more in a
state of cultivation, and the sugar-cane flourishes in verdant
beauty where nothing was to be seen but rank and tangled weeds,
or scanty herbage.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>To put
down slavery, then, we have only to let free labour have fair
play.&nbsp; It is not the continuance of monopoly, but
emigration, that is wanted.&nbsp; The first consequence of
emancipation was the formation of a middle class where it had not
before existed, which middle class was entirely subtracted from
the agricultural population.&nbsp; 718,525 human beings were
emancipated in our sugar colonies, including the Mauritius, of
whom one-fourth were immediately absorbed in the formation of a
middle class.&nbsp; Hence the deficiency in labour which at
present affects the West India Islands.&nbsp; We believe, with
Mr. Laird, <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a> &ldquo;that it is the <i>quantity</i>,
not the quality, of labour that is wanting.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed
it has been shown that a free negro in Guiana creates double the
amount of sugar that his enslaved countryman in Cuba does.</p>
<p>In many parts of the East labourers may be hired at
three-halfpence and two-pence a day.&nbsp; From the evidence
given before the West African Committee, we learn, that wages
average from two-pence to four-pence a day in our three
settlements on the coast of Africa.&nbsp; The cost of the slave
in Cuba or Brazil equals this.&nbsp; Let the experiment be fairly
tried, and it will soon be evident that slave labour must be
driven out of the market.&nbsp; That becomes still plainer when
we look at the actual condition of the slave-grown sugar.&nbsp;
From Cuba every fresh post brings a continuance of bad
news.&nbsp; There is a want of capital and skill&mdash;a blight
rests upon the land&mdash;property and life are insecure.&nbsp;
On March 6th, a statement appeared in the <i>Anti-Slavery
Reporter</i>, giving an account of the wretched condition of the
slaves.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are credibly informed,&rdquo; observes
the editor, &ldquo;that on some of the sugar plantations <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>in Cuba the
slaves are in a most miserable condition&mdash;not less than the
half of a gang being sickly, covered with sores, and even
cripples&mdash;the whip supplying virtue and strength, health and
numbers.&nbsp; Unable to &lsquo;trot&rsquo; to the field, they
are placed on carts and carried to it, there to creep and toil by
the help of the lash.&nbsp; No description can exhibit the
neglect, cruelty, and inhumanity, with which they are
treated.&nbsp; In crop-time they have no holiday&mdash;no
Sunday&mdash;and no sleep!&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> gave the
following, as from Havanna, under date of February
17:&mdash;&ldquo;A slaver, with 1200 negroes, has arrived on our
coast.&nbsp; They have been offered at 340 dollars a-head, and
our planters has determined to buy no more, and none of this
cargo has been disposed of.&nbsp; <i>No one is now inclined to
encourage this abominable traffic</i>, <i>which begins to be
considered as highly injurious to the welfare of the
island</i>.&nbsp; Several corporations and planters have given in
reports favourable to the total abolition of the slave trade; it
is understood these will be sent forthwith to the Spanish
Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The negroes have imbibed ideas of freedom which at no distant
time will produce, by fair means or foul, a change in their
condition.&nbsp; The planter already begins to perceive, that it
is far better to be the employer of faithful and contented
labourers, than the lord of men who feel their wrongs, and who
wait but the first moment of revenge.&nbsp; Capital, the
life-blood of industry, will never flow into a country till the
capitalist has a pledge&mdash;a pledge no land of slaves can ever
give&mdash;that the life he hazards, and the money he invests,
are alike secure.&nbsp; Were the duty on sugar so reduced
to-morrow as to put it in the power of the working man to consume
as much as he required, an impulse would be given to the
production of sugar which would create a demand for
capital&mdash;which capital would alone be safely invested where
labour is free.&nbsp; With a plentiful supply of labourers, no
one can deny that Jamaica <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>would be a far more eligible country
for the capitalist than Cuba or Brazil; and hence the slave-trade
dealers would be thrown for ever out of the markets of the
world.</p>
<p>To put down slavery, then, we must under-sell the slave
dealer.&nbsp; Emigration from the coast of Africa to the West
Indies must be encouraged.&nbsp; At present wages in these
islands are unnaturally high.&nbsp; They cannot, however, long
remain so.&nbsp; We are glad to learn that the negroes are well
off; but it cannot be expected that the West India monopoly
should be continued merely that the emancipated slave may drink
at his ease his Madeira or Champagne.&nbsp; It will be well for
him if he prepares himself for the change that must shortly
come.&nbsp; It is not to be expected that the proprietor who
cultivates his estate at a loss, should continue to employ his
capital without return.&nbsp; Unless there is a change, that
capital must be withdrawn; and, thrown upon his own resources,
the negro labourer will sink into a state of degradation hopeless
and complete. <a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a>&nbsp; Should it be found that the
emigration scheme will not work well, it by no means follows that
our only alternative is to continue the monopoly.&nbsp; A late
writer, <a name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a> on the state of Jamaica, expresses it
as his opinion <i>that the resources of the island are not above
half developed</i>; he declares that the implements used in the
cultivation of the cane are in the most primitive state
imaginable; and that were but the improvements in machines
introduced there, which have obtained elsewhere, there would be
no need whatever for additional labourers.</p>
<p>This may be true of Jamaica, but it will not apply <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>equally to
other parts of the West Indies, where labourers are needed; and
Africa is the quarter to which we must naturally turn for a
supply.&nbsp; We find men in a state of practical
slavery&mdash;sunk in the lowest scale of being; and we maintain
the way to humanise them, to give them habits of industry and
ideas of trade, is to bring them into contact with the advanced
civilisation of the west.&nbsp; Thanks to the labours of the
missionaries, they will find their emancipated fellow-countrymen
intelligent, moral, and religious men.&nbsp; They will become
subject to the same ameliorating influences&mdash;old things will
be put away, principles of good will be formed&mdash;the savage
will be lost in the advancing dignity of the man.</p>
<p>Let the West Indian proprietor, then, take the degraded savage
and convert him into a useful member of society, and in the same
manner let the free-trader go and convert the slave-owner into an
honest man.&nbsp; In both cases a restrictive policy has been
found to be fraught with inevitable ill.&nbsp; It were time that
they both should retire.&nbsp; Our aim should be to create in
slave states a public opinion against the vile system that stains
the land, and not to excite feelings of enmity against ourselves
because we exclude them from our market, and seek to brand them
as outcasts from society.&nbsp; Not by such pharisaical modes of
procedure shall we obtain our end.&nbsp; If we would do a man
good, we must teach him to look upon us as friends, and not
foes.&nbsp; We have no right to shut up a man in his guilt; and,
as a nation is but an aggregate of individuals, the principles of
action that obtain in the one case must be equally valid with
respect to the other.&nbsp; We heap contumely and scorn on the
heads of the American slaveholders, and refuse to do business
with the merchants of Brazil, and by such conduct directly
deprive ourselves of what influence for good we might otherwise
have it in our power to wield.&nbsp; It is time that we turn over
a new leaf; <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>that we act more in accordance with Him who makes his
sun to shine, and his rain to descend, upon the good and the bad;
that we speak in friendship to our fellow-man, however degraded
he may be, and win him over to the adoption of that which is just
and true.&nbsp; Experience, the great teacher of mankind, has
shown in a thousand instances that in our efforts to put down
slavery by restrictive policy and armed suppression, we have, at
the most lavish expenditure of treasure and life, done nothing
but create misery and ill-will.&nbsp; It is the part of a wise
man to abandon a plan which he sees has entirely failed.&nbsp; We
may, by so doing, expose ourselves to the charge of
inconsistency,&mdash;the stupid sneer, the unmeaning laugh, of
men to whom experience may preach in vain, may be ours; but we
shall have the consolation, the sure reward, of men who, seeking
that which will promote the happiness of the family of man, when
they find themselves in the wrong course, immediately abandon it
for the right.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the preceding pages we have endeavoured to advocate Free
Trade, as the only one thing by which slavery can be
destroyed.&nbsp; We now come to a subject of equal
importance&mdash;the claims of our countrymen at home.&nbsp; We
plead not for the Manchester warehouseman, cribbed, cabined, and
confined by our wretched system of commercial policy, but we
plead for the overtaxed and under-fed hard-working men and women
of Great Britain.&nbsp; It is well to be tenderly alive to the
concerns of the West Indian negro, but the charity that exhausts
itself on them partakes of the same mongrel character as that
sensibility which sheds floods of tears over the feigned
distresses of the stage, and looks unmoved upon the miseries of a
world.&nbsp; A reduction in the price of sugar would most
certainly be an <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>inestimable boon to the working man.&nbsp; Such a step
taken by government would produce no increase in the consumption
of sugar on the part of the middle or higher classes, but it
would enable the poorer classes at once to use one of the most
nutritious and essential articles of food.&nbsp; If you would
preserve a man from drunkenness, make his home happy; let him
have something better than the meagre fare which too generally
awaits him.&nbsp; On the government which, by its interference,
deprives the operative of the fair fruit of his labour, which
drives him to the alehouse, to avoid the home rendered wretched
by their accursed agency, rest the blame and guilt occasioned by
the degradation and destruction of the body and soul of
man.&nbsp; Different is the judgment of Heaven from that of the
world.&nbsp; Could our voice reach the ears of our senators, we
would ask them to pause ere they continued in a course of
legislation which has been a fruitful source of vice&mdash;a
course of legislation which, like the destroying angel, has
spread death through the land.&nbsp; We would say to them,
&ldquo;Law-makers, see there the wretched slave of vice; the
fault is not his, but yours.&nbsp; From your costly clubs, from
your glittering saloons, flushed with revelry and wine, you have
gone to the House, and, in the fulness of your power and pride,
declared that his hearth should be desolate&mdash;that the crust
he gnaws he should earn at the price of his life&mdash;that
misery and want, like attendant handmaids, should follow on his
steps; and if he has shrunk abashed from their presence&mdash;if
his heart has failed him in the hour of need&mdash;if he has
forgotten his manhood and his immortality&mdash;if he has joined

require an account at your hands&mdash;when it <a

<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Between
1824 and 1840, the population had increased five millions, and
yet there had been an actual falling off in the consumption of
sugar of no less than 377,302 cwts. and a loss of revenue of
&pound;192,910, to say nothing of the consequent loss of
employment which the five millions would otherwise have enjoyed,
resulting from the impulse given to manufactures and shipping, by
an increase in the sugar trade.&nbsp; The cost, exclusive of
duty, of 3,764,710 cwts. retained for home consumption in the
year, as calculated by Mr. Porter, at the <i>Gazette</i> average
prices, was &pound;9,156,872.&nbsp; The cost of the same quantity
of Brazil or Havanna sugar, of equal quality, would have been
&pound;4,141,181, so that in one year we paid &pound;5,015,691
more than the prices which the rest of the inhabitants of Europe
would have paid for an equal quantity of sugar.&nbsp; In that
year the total value of our exports to our sugar colonies was
under &pound;4,000,000, so that we should have &ldquo;gained a
million of money in that one year by following the true principle
of buying in the cheapest market, even though we had made the
sugar-growers a present of all the goods which they took from
us.&rdquo; <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>The Brazilian ambassador has been in vain endeavouring to
effect a reduction of the duty imposed on foreign sugar.&nbsp;
The reign of monopoly is to be continued yet a little
longer.&nbsp; We are to go on throwing away our money, and losing
our trade.&nbsp; The working man&rsquo;s food is taxed out of all
proportion.&nbsp; We may not use the cheap sugar of Brazil, which
is imported&mdash;slave-grown as it is&mdash;into England, and,
here refined, is then sold to the settler in Australia, or the
emancipated West Indian labourer, for fourpence a pound.&nbsp;
No, the unemancipated white labourer must pay a high price for
his adulterated sugar; for be it remembered that 400,000 cwts. of
various ingredients <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>are annually used, and which, cheapening the price,
though then it is much higher than that of the genuine article
would be, were we allowed to import it for home consumption from
Brazil, is consumed principally by the lower orders of
society.&nbsp; The necessaries of life in this country being thus
heavily taxed, the cost of our manufactures is raised, and, as a
consequence, the German under-sells us in the Brazil market; and,
more wonderful still, the American enters our own colonies, such
as the Cape of Good Hope, and under-sells us there; and thus it
is that we are punished for our sins.&nbsp; It must also be
remembered that, in spite of our virtual exclusion of foreign
produce, Java, and Cuba, and the Brazils, had grown sugar in such
abundance, as that our merchants have three separate times begged
permission of the government to introduce it merely for the
purposes of agriculture, promising, if their request were
granted, to spoil it in such a manner as that it should be
totally unfit for human food.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding a duty of 63<i>s.</i> in their favour, the
monopolists complain of the low price of sugar.&nbsp; From the
circular of Messrs. Truman and Co., we find that, whilst the
highest price of British sugar (West India middling to fine) is
68<i>s.</i> per cwt., the highest price for foreign (Havannah
white) is only 28<i>s.</i> per cwt.; and thus they are getting
nearly 150 per cent. more than we are paying for foreign
sugar.&nbsp; Again, the lowest price of English sugar (Bengal
brown) is 48<i>s.</i>, whilst the lowest price of the foreign
article (Java) is 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and thus getting nearly
200 per cent. more than foreign sugar can be got for, they have
the impudence to grumble about low prices!&nbsp; Pretty cool!
considering the shameless system of plundering they have been
carrying on.</p>
<p>This immense difference in the cost of the two articles is
equalised by the heavy duty imposed on the one, and <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>the light
duty upon the other: that on the highest foreign produce being
238 per cent. on the value of the sugar, whilst the duty on the
highest-priced colonial sugar is but 37 per cent.; and the
lowest-priced colonial sugar pays but 50 per cent. duty, whilst
the lowest-priced foreign sugar actually pays 400 per
cent.!&nbsp; Be it remembered, this goes not to the government at
home, but is so much money put into the pockets of the West
Indian monopolists.&nbsp; It is reckoned by a writer in the
<i>League</i> that &ldquo;the sum paid for sugar at the
monopolists&rsquo; shops, more than it could be bought for at the
Brazil shop, is &pound;7,000,000 per annum.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same
writer gives the following statement of the case:&mdash;</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>And thus an article of consumption, that has now become an
essential, is raised to an extravagant price to maintain a
monopoly, of which even the monopolists themselves complain.</p>
<p>Considered as a question of revenue, it is extremely desirable
that our differential duties on sugar should be abolished.&nbsp;
The increased price we pay goes not to government, but into the
monopolist&rsquo;s pocket; he alone is benefited by it; the
consumer pays 20<i>s.</i> a cwt. more than he otherwise would do
to the grower of the favoured produce.&nbsp; Equalise the duties,
and, as was exemplified in the reductions that took place in the
duties on coffee, by making a decrease of price to the consumer,
we get an increase of revenue.&nbsp; It may not be amiss to state
that Mr. M&lsquo;Gregor Laird declared, in a late speech before
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the
anniversary meeting of the Glasgow Emancipation Society, that, if
the people of England consumed sugar at the same rate per head as
the population of New South Wales, the annual consumption would
be 900,000 tons.&nbsp; The Editor of the <i>Economist</i> has so
fully proved this part of the subject, that we cannot do better
than give his own words.&nbsp; We quote from an article headed
&ldquo;Free Trade and the National Debt,&rdquo; that appeared in
that paper on the 7th October last:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our consumption of sugar last year was
3,876,465 cwts., at a cost of 65<i>s.</i> per cwt. (wholesale
price), and, consequently, at that rate, the country paid for
sugar &pound;12,598,511.&nbsp; Now, there is every reason to
believe that, if sugar were cheaper, the same sum would still be
expended upon it, and a correspondingly increased quantity
consumed.&nbsp; In this opinion we are supported by the very
extraordinary fact that the annual consumption of sugar, which,
in 1811, averaged 23&frac14; lbs. per head on the whole
population of Great Britain and Ireland, was reduced, in 1842, in
consequence of the restriction of quantity, to the rate of
15&#8542;lbs. per head, while the paupers in our workhouses are
allowed at the rate of 23&frac34;lbs., and the seamen in her
Majesty&rsquo;s service 34 lbs. per head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, assume that the duty on foreign sugar were
reduced to 24<i>s.</i>, the same as we now pay on colonial sugar,
the price of sugar would be lowered thereby to 45<i>s.</i> per
cwt. instead of 65<i>s.</i>; then the sum of &pound;12,598,511,
which we last year expended on sugar, would command 5,599,338
cwts., in place of 3,876,465 cwts., being an additional
consumption, at precisely the same entire cost.&nbsp; Now, at
present, all the revenue which is derived from sugar is from the
duty of that on 24<i>s.</i> on that of colonial grown (the high
differential duty excluding all other), and on the quantity
consumed last year yielded the sum of &pound;4,651,758.&nbsp; By
the proposed equalisation of duties this sum would remain
untouched, but an additional quantity (which at present gives no
revenue at all) of 1,722,873 cwts. would, at the rate of
24<i>s.</i> per cwt., raise the revenue to &pound;6,719,205.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result, therefore, would be, that for the same sum
of money which the country expended last year in sugar, an
additional quantity of 1,722,873 cwts. would be enjoyed by the
community, which would only restore the average consumption of
23&frac14; lbs. per head of 1811, an additional revenue of
&pound;2,067,447 would be given to <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the State, and an increase of trade
amounting to nearly &pound;4,000,000 annually would be
experienced by the dealers, merchants, and carriers of
sugar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, with us all this seems very reasonable, and we are not a
little surprised to find, as we certainly do, many intelligent
and philanthropic men joining in the outcry against slave-grown
sugar which the West India planters, those paragons of excellence
and humanity, have had wit enough to raise, and which has
answered their purposes remarkably well.&nbsp; We are told it is
slave-grown.&nbsp; What of that?&nbsp; Half the Brazil
slave-grown sugar is bought by British money, and refined by
British skill, and then sold by British merchants all over the
globe.&nbsp; Our cotton is slave-grown&mdash;tobacco, which
yields a revenue of three million pounds and a half, is
slave-grown.&nbsp; From the southern states of America and Mexico
we import slave-grown rice, indigo, and cochineal; of the
manufactures we export, half are of cotton, imported from the
slave states, and upon their produce the millions of our
manufacturing population depend for their subsistence.&nbsp; It
would require no little impudence for any of the English
monopolists to tell the Brazilians that we were so squeamish that
we could not deal with them, because their sugar was slave-grown,
when every one knows that our merchants gladly trade in and allow
every one to have it cheap and good except our own hungry,
wretched, and perishing poor. <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; They are to be
taxed and fleeced to keep up the <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>West India monopoly&mdash;their bone
and blood are to be preyed on by the harpies that lust for human
gore.&nbsp; That their desires may be gratified&mdash;that the
value of their estates may be unnaturally kept up&mdash;that
their vested rights, the rights of the robber and the pickpocket,
if such a term can be applied to them, may be preserved&mdash;the
English labourer, from a state of honest independence, is
degraded into pauperism, dies in the parish workhouse, and rots
in the parish vault.&nbsp; Shame on this Christian land, with its
stately churches, its noble mansions, with its swarms of
well-paid luxurious priests, with its peers of unrivalled wealth
and power, with its sons boasting their royal blood&mdash;shame
on such men, that for one hour they suffer so wretched a system
to continue!&nbsp; It is well that they should talk of their love
to religion and law, but the religion and law that connive at
crying abuses and monstrous wrongs, can neither please Heaven nor
bless <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>man:
they evidently are unworthy of the name they claim for
themselves.</p>
<p>To those who are really in earnest in the cry against
slave-grown produce, we say, that it is abundantly proved that
the West Indian monopoly tends directly to keep up slavery.&nbsp;
If that were abolished, we might expect to see slavery
destroyed.&nbsp; The monopoly enables the West Indian planter to
pay an unreasonably high price for labour, in consequence of
which there is an importation of labour into the market&mdash;an
unnatural demand is created.&nbsp; The high price the West Indian
planter gets for his sugar, makes it answer his purpose to pay
more for hire than his rivals can, and the consequence is, that
the neighbouring European colonists are afraid to emancipate
their slaves, knowing well, that directly they would leave them
for the monopoly market, and they would be left without a hand to
till the soil.&nbsp; For instance, we give the following
case:&mdash;A large slave-owner, in Dutch Guiana, thus addressed
the editor of the <i>Economist</i>, when that gentleman was at
Amsterdam.&nbsp; &ldquo;We should be glad,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to follow your example, and emancipate our slaves, if it
were possible; but as long as your differential duties are
maintained it will be impossible.&nbsp; Here is an account-sale
of sugar produced in our colony, netting a return of &pound;11
per hogshead to the planter in Surinam; and here is an
account-sale of similar sugar sold in London, netting a return of
&pound;33 to the planter in Demerara; the difference ascribable
only to your differential duty.&nbsp; The fields of these two
classes of planters are separated only by a few ditches.&nbsp;
Now, such is the effort made by the planter in Demerara to extend
his cultivation, to secure the high price of &pound;33, that he
is importing free labourers from the hills of Hindostan, and from
the coast of Africa, at great cost; and is willing to pay higher
prices than even labour will command in Europe.&nbsp; Let us then
emancipate our slaves, which, if it <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>had any effect, would confer the
privilege of the choice of employer, and Dutch Guiana would be
depopulated in a day&mdash;an easy means of increasing the supply
of labour to the planters of Demerara, at the cost of entire
annihilation of the cultivation of the estates in Surinam.&nbsp;
But abandon your differential duties; give us the same price for
our produce, and thus enable us to pay the same rate of wages,
and I, for one, will not object to liberate my slaves
to-morrow.&rdquo; <a name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a></p>
<p>We would not damp the sympathy which is felt for the enslaved
<i>producer</i> of sugar in Brazil; but we would claim some
portion of that sympathy on behalf of the toil-worn
<i>consumer</i> at home.&nbsp; The Lancashire operatives,
starving in our midst, have ties on us which we must not and
cannot overlook.&nbsp; Let their case be considered&mdash;let
their prayers be heard.&nbsp; Let justice be done to them.&nbsp;
They are our brethren, and their case is ours.&nbsp; Let us seek
for them the abolition of all monopoly&mdash;for one does but
involve another&mdash;they are all the results of the same impure
system&mdash;they all stand and fall together.&nbsp; In every
country under heaven the friends of the people are ranged on the
one side, and their foes and the friends of monopoly on the
other.&nbsp; If a monopoly of legislation had never existed at
home, a monopoly of trade would never have existed in favour of
any colony or nation under the sun.&nbsp; Let the legislative
monopoly continue, and we shall not only peril our trade abroad,
but our very existence at home, and England&rsquo;s glory shall
vanish as a dream.&nbsp; All that has been written by historians,
and said by orators, and sung by poets, of a nation&rsquo;s
gradual decline and ignominious extinction, shall we realise in
her hapless fate.</p>
<p>The Mayor of Liverpool, at a public meeting there, was heard
to say, that our legislators were gentlemen.&nbsp; Whether <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>this was said
ironically, or otherwise, we know not.&nbsp; The assertion
certainly contains a great deal of truth.&nbsp; We cannot look at
one single act of theirs without finding it full of blunders and
bulls.&nbsp; By their own folly we lost half our American
market.&nbsp; Brazil, the fourth foreign market we have, we are
about to lose.&nbsp; Our artizans are overworked to raise
annually four or five million pounds&rsquo; worth of goods, which
are then taken, and, as it were, drowned in the bottom of the
sea.&nbsp; What a man might have for once buying, the
legislature, in its wisdom, makes him pay for twice.&nbsp; It
decrees that a man must toil all day for that which he might
otherwise have for half a day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; What admirable
policy!&nbsp; Blessed are its effects, in the misery it has shed
over the homes of our operatives&mdash;in the life-blood it has
wrung from the labourer&rsquo;s heart!&nbsp; It is time that
whatever of manhood there is left in this Saxon and once happy
land&mdash;whatever of stern valour that once distinguished us
from the nations of the earth, and which the struggle for the
pittance that barely keeps up life has not frittered away, or
which the Union House has not starved out&mdash;should arouse and
join in that cry which demands that man&rsquo;s rights should be
given back to him&mdash;that his serfdom be abolished&mdash;that
his brotherhood be owned&mdash;that England should no longer be
one vast poor-house&mdash;that life should no longer be a source
of sorrow, but of joy&mdash;no longer what priestism and class
legislation have made it, a thing to be feared and shunned, but a
boon to be desired&mdash;that that should be a blessing, which in
times past, was a bitter curse.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
